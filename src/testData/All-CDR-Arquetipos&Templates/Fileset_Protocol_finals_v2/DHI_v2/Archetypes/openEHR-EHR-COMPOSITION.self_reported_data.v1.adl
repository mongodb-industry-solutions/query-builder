The scope of content for this archetype can be very broad and be inclusive of many contexts. The anticipated scope of content includes, but not limited to:
- self-generated responses to questionnaires, including PREMs or PROMs
- pain or mood diary
- tobacco smoking diary
- self-generated health summary for sharing with others
- self-monitoring of measurements and observations

The anticipated use of this archetype includes, but is not limited to:
- submission of a self-reported questionnaire to a clinician in advance of a planned contact
- submission of a contact request form
- daily measurements within a Personal Health Record
- patient-entered data in a shared clinical portal
- patient generated records of information from personal or medical devices

The main Sections/Content component has been deliberately left unconstrained. This will allow it to be populated with any SECTION or ENTRY archetypes appropriate for the clinical purpose within a template.">
